            Steps to the most simple type of meditation:
            Crossed legs, sitting on a cushion/block/similar (because otherwise it's rather uncomfortable having your butt below your ankles
            Eyes and face relaxed, eyes partially opened with almost a smile on
            Lifting through the crown of your head, spine neutral
            Hands in lap, forming an 'arch', wow this one is hard to put into words...
            Breathing, breathing, breathing, breating, all about breathing
            Deep slow breaths, through the nose, filling your lower belly and working up to inflate yourself with each breath, reversing it when breathing otu
            No rushing the breath, pause slightly at each breath in and out
            Breathe naturally (similar to this) after a few moments
            Hardest part: do not think about anything
            Nothing
            Seriously
            You are a rock, a foundation, any thoughts you may have are just drifting by on the breeze
            Do not chase them, let the thoughts pass on the wind, focus on the breath if need be, completely still
            You underestimate how hard this is
