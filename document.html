    <h1>Homework 3<br/><small>3 March 2014</h1>
    <p>Glen Oakley - much experience with JSSML (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)</p>
    <p>Teddy Sudol - rather dislikes web development in general</p>
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p><a href="index.html">Project Page</a></p>
    <p>The website itself is a guide on how to meditate.  It provides a breif explanation of what meditation is and then runs through the basic steps of meditation.  It can be found alongside this file, or at <a href="http://goakley.github.io/secret-project/">http://goakley.github.io/secret-project/</a></p>
    <h2>Need Finding</h2>
    <p>It seemed quite obvious that people in general do not take the time to fully relax.  We established a theory that the problem might be a lack of knowledge on how to relax.  Asking various students about their relaxation habits showed the theory to be correct, and many students expressed interest in a website that would show them how to relax.  Meditation is an accessible and easy way to relax, so it was chosen as the site topic.</p>
    <h2>Site Design</h2>
    <p>Since the topic of the site is meditation, the design focuses on an uncluttered interface with a mild (blue) colour scheme.  The information presented is linear in nature, progressing from an explanation of the subject to a meditation guide and then to resources, making a simple scrolling-based website the most obvious choice for the project.  Each section of the site is well-separated from the others, providing a clear distinction between different topics and sub-topics.  Pictures and graphics are used to break up the otherwise text-heavy content of the site, and also clarify the meaning of different sections.  Unfortunately, a lack of artistic creativity in the team prevented experimentation with different fonts, which may have increased the visual appeal of the site.</p>
    <h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
    <h3>Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The site maintains a constant visual theme throughout.  Similarly structured data appears the same regardless of section and in a matter suitable for the content (lists look like lists, for example).  Sections of the same rank appear in the same style.</li>
      <li>The site can be navigated using standard web navigation techniques.  Containing the entire project on a single page removes any difficulty some users might have in navigating between pages.  Images have alternate text that conveys the meaning even if the image itself cannot be viewed. The site is simple enough that it should work with almost any browser, though it may not work well with smaller screens.</li>
      <li>If a user hovers over a section of text, that section is darkened to emphasize the content, making it clearer to the user.</li>
      <li>The site concludes with links to other meditation resources, providing a clear ending to the content of the site while also directing users to places where they can learn more.</li>
      <li>The site is completely static, and thus is not subject to any errors during use.  If an image is unable to load, the browser will instead present a very short description of what the image would have contained.</li>
      <li>Since no actions can be taken on the site, the site only has one state, which is the state created on page load.</li>
      <li>The interface of the site is technically within control of the user's browser and is outside the scope of this project.  The site does not modify any of the default actions performed by browser (e.g. the scrolling style is not overwritten).</li>
      <li>The user is free to scroll up and down the page to review information they may have forgotten.  There is no enforced speed at which the user must navigate the site, allowing users to digest all the information before moving on.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Survey</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>On a scale of 1 to 5, how interested were you in meditation before visiting the site? (1 = Less Interested, 5 = More Interested)</li>
        <li>On a scale of 1 to 5, how interested are you in meditation after visiting the site? (1 = Less Interested, 5 = More Interested)</li>
        <li>Were you able to follow the directions for meditating successfully? (Yes/No)</li>
        <li>Did the images on the site aid your understanding? (1 = Unhelpful, 3 = Neutral, 5 = Helpful)</li>
        <li>Did you investigate the resources listed at the bottom of the site? (Yes/No/Didn't see them)</li>
        <li>Were the directions for each step clear? (1 = Very Unclear, 5 = Very Clear)</li>
        <li>Would guided meditation (someone leading you through the process) be helpful? (Yes/No/Long answer possible)</li>
        <li>Are you considering integrating meditation into your every-day routine? (Yes/No)</li>
    </ol>
